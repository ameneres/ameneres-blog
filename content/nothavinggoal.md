Putting my effort on output not on the outcome.

> A goal is something that goes away when you hit it.
> _Jason Fried_

Jason Fried talks about this in his famous post [I've never had a goal](https://m.signalvnoise.com/ive-never-had-a-goal/) He explains that he likes to approach things continuously. Not in hitting this goal. Then the next. And the next..

One of the reasons over the last 5 years (at least) that made me feel anxious and borderline depressed were the expectations of reaching a goal. I've been dreaming of turning [Dedica](https://dedica.co) into a super successful project. It's not yet. The problem is that high expectations when unmet lead to a bunch of negative emotions. That had ramifications in a lot of aspects of my life. This [article](https://www.simplemindfulness.com/why-expectations-are-evil/) goes even further. Expectations are the root of all evil.

Learning about the stoic philosophy is helping in shaping my thinking. On [The war of reality vs Expectations](https://dailystoic.com/reality-vs-expectations/) you can see how a stoic aproaches life, expactations and how to interpret reality. "Projecting fixed expectations in life blinds you to everything but the one-track, imaginary path you’ve predicted."

My present is focused on the process and the output. What I do and how often I do it. The outcome is, for the most part, outside of my control. I need to be comfortable that some or maybe all of my projects will not become successful businesses. That's a possibility. The focus is on the path and the learning.

Back to Jason Fried. He shared a great quote.

Last week was still pretty much dedicated to define my full-time employment. Hope to get it resolved this week to put more focus on the side-projects until new gig starts.

I've been trying out [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) over the last month and I'm very happy so far with it.  It will be worth to do a proper review.

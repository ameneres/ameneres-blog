Spent most of last week tinkering with design. Watched some brilliant videos by  [Steve Schoger](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxqiDtkXtOCNJdckODHk9YA) and [Malewicz](https://www.youtube.com/c/MalewiczHype/playlists). Watching the pros designing live is super insightful. 

I said I wasn't going to do [courses](https://ameneres.com/post/designlevel1)  to learn design but I found that I'd bought [Visual Design for Web developers](https://www.udemy.com/course/graphic-design-for-web-designers-ui-designers-developers/) on Udemy. Started going through that as it seems very practical and short enough to go through the materials quickly.

Changed the design on this blog. Still ugly. Lacks proper structure but better than what it was.

It's easy to see that I didn't make much progress. That's what the Weekly Accountability System is for.

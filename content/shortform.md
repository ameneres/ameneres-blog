Something I'd like to do is write long form articles. A more indepth analysis on a specific subject. But I feel like that requires a lot more time than the short bites I've been writing daily. 

The focus for now is practice. On the [output](https://ameneres.com/post/nothavinggoal). Repetition is what I need. That's how you improve on anything. No wonder in sports they put a lot of effort in to the "reps". 

I'm conscious that I need the reps. Also need to keep an eye out for deliberate practice. Good thing that I'm not writing about the same thing everyday. I need to be careful not to fall into mindless repetition.

Need to keep an eye out for deliberate practice. Good thing that I'm not writing about the same thing everyday. 

For now, I'll keep producing only short form posts. The intent so far is to capture my thoughts. It's worth analyzing if it's just a brain dump or I'm creating value for my future self (or you dear reader). 

Brain dump isn't worthless. Yet, translating that into insight or learning opportunity is more interesting. It's difficult to translate it in the future when my opinions, beliefs and experiences may have changed me in a way that the initial meaning is lost.

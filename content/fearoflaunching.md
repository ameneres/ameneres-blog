Yesterday I launched a new project. An ebook called Research for sales.

It was difficult to push the publish button. Not the "publish it's live on the web" button. The "Linkedin check my upcoming eBook" push button. 

I felt that Linkedin was the best platform to publish. I believe there are better platforms, forums, communities to share my ebook. But, I don't have the network or rapport to publish without getting blocked. 
Linkedin provides a good sales audience and I've enough connections in this audience to get some reaction.
 
As most people launching new projects I was very hesitant. What went through my mind before publishing it?
- What if no one reacts to it?
- What if acquaintances think it's stupid?
- What if strangers who see the post think "what's this rubbish"?
- What if this is not successful? Doesn't it impact my ability to share other projects with my network in the future?
- I'm doing a career pivot next year. Does it have any negative impact on my transition?
- Do I still want to pursue this project if no one engages with my post?
- Will they like the website?
- Is the copywrite good enough to have people signing up to buy the book?

Writing all this now doesn't sound or feel that bad. In fact, what I felt is my anticipation of someone’s expectations of my work and felt insecure if they don't approve. Good thing someone wiser has already though about this.

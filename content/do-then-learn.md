It's so easy as a creator to spend time searching for the perfect answer. 

"Best way to build X". "How to use whatever platform". "How to design for X". "How to improve conversation rates". "Best technologies for X". "How to build an audience".

Different projects, different people, different customers, different problems, different needs, different solutions, difference circumstances and constraints. There's not perfect answer.

Do then learn to do better.

Started to work on my info product. Research for sales.

Following first week of [Year of Hustle](https://stackingthebricks.com/year-of-hustle/). The work on week 1 is to create a coming soon page with description of the pain and email sign up. Create a chunk of the product. Share the page. Want to finish week one latest by Friday.

Wrote the copywrite for the coming soon page. Started putting together a landing page. 

Most importantly made a few decisions on the tech stack without spending a month on it. I'm going to use [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/) with [Content](https://content.nuxtjs.org/) module. I could have used a CMS or a noCode solution but I'm comfortable enough with Nuxt to be productive. Most likely Converkit for email signups. Design for now is basic [TailwindUI](https://tailwindui.com) components.

Trying to avoid any kind of optimization at this stage.

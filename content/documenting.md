Where do I spend my time?

My first step towards being more productive was to [reduce the noise](https://ameneres.com/post/reducingnoise). 

Second step is to document my day. At least the important things,
- Meetings
- Articles read
- Tasks completed
- Podcasts listened
- Videos watched
- Sports or exercise

I don't want to be super religious about it. Initially, I know this will feel like super micro managening my day. The intention is to understand where I'm spending my time.

I still feel like spending too much time on stuff - can't really pin point what exactly.

It is possible that I'm chasing too many things and feel like I'm accomplishing very little. In any case, I want to be very intentional with my time.

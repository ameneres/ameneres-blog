It's time for me to think about long term. 

Over the last decade I've been obsessed with creating an internet business. The idea of building something from scratch, creating my own luck and having the ability to choose what type of project and company (if it gets to that) it would be is very appealing to me. 

I got stuck on a big idea when I was trying to build [Dedica][https://dedica.co]. It's funny how I thought deep down that one day I'd realise I did everything wrong. I was hoping that day would never arrive. But it did. I wish it came sooner.

That big idea is what lead me to do such a poor job. I was trying to get there as fast as I can. Every time I was working on it I saw the potential and the successful business. I was skipping the part before getting there. The work involved in growing a business from nothing.

A successful project is nothing but a group of activities performed over time. A group of habits. As I shift my thinking, what habits can I sustain over time?

My building process needs to be sustainable so I can enjoy it, avoid anxiety and push through when I need.

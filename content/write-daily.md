...or write daily and publish daily.

This is a daunting task. Am I up for this? I've been writing a lot more recently but it mainly is putting down my thoughts on a journal. The topics of vary wildly:
- "What did I do?"
- "How did I feel?"
- "Was I a good parent today?"
- ... and so on


Publishing is a different game. Publishing what to be relevant to who? In the surge of [digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) I'll start with that.

Now, Seth Godin writes a [blog](https://seths.blog/) post everyday. He says that [the first 1000 are the most difficult](https://seths.blog/2018/10/the-first-1000-are-the-most-difficult/). That's funny. If I publish daily that's almost 3 years. If plublish every week day (~260) it takes almost 4 years. If I do it weekly, that's 19 years. Thanks Seth. I'm encouraged and motivated ðŸ˜Ÿ. 

I know that if I do this I'll be happy I did it. But it requires effort. So, let's break this down. 

Publish everyday for week. That's where I need to focus on. Not what's ahead nor what's behind. Every week post once a day.

Starting next week Monday's post will be about accountability. Tracking the progress I've made on different projects. This will be fun to look at a year from now. It's also a chance to understand if I actually did anything for a project. 

Sometimes you spend so much time thinking about a project that it feels like progress. Yet, nothing happened, nothing changed. It's ok to just think but I don't want to be under the illusion that progress was made. Thinking without action is just that thinking. Nothing wrong with it. It's just that I want to see progress on my "projects".

Think it's worth to define what a project can be.  For now:
- Learning a new skill
- Improving a skill
- Building a product 
- Writing an long form article

(will update this section if other things come up) 

There is no pressure to do more. Hustle more. Just an accountability system to see where I am.

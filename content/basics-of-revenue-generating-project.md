This is not supposed to be a complex theory. It's more of a mind map to have it ingrained in my brain. The main areas required to think about before launching a project. It's supposed to be something very simple. 

1. Why it matters and to whom?
2. How do they find you or your product?
3. How to build / create it?
4. How customers experience your product and company?

This is not final and I'll update as I learn. In future posts I'll dive into each of these areas.

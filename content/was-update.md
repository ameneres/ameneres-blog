Taking a break from this system. There are several reasons for it. It's holidays season, kids at home a lot, I need to relax to start the new job fresh in January. Most importantly I need to tone down my personal efficiency (future post soon).

I'm still working on a bunch of stuff but I want to do it when I feel like it. Also want to avoid missing things on my "to do next week" list and feel bad about it. 

Maybe I need a better system. It'll be worth reflecting on what worked well and what didn't. On the first Monday of 2021, WAS or whatever replaces it will be back.

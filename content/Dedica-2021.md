"What should I do with Dedica?"

This is a question I've asked a lot of times over the past 6 months. It's clear that the current format is not working. There's too much complexity in the product. How did it end up there with so much complexity? 

I'm more inclined to think that it's a matter of definition. The problem wasn't well defined. The result is a half backed product for an undefined problem. 

In 2021, I want to try something different. Define the problem I'm solving, set constraints for the project, create sustainable habits, iterate.

I'm starting from scratch again.

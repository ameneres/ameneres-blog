Bit of  progress last week. Not ideal though. I'm behind on the Year of Hustle. 

Tried Gumroad, Convertkit and Mailerlite. I've chosen to use a Landing page from an email marketing software. The templates are very difficult to customize. Maybe it's a good thing but I was expecting it to be easier to put together. 

I've resisted the temptation to built it myself for now but I'm not sure if that'll continue.

**Done last week**
- [x] Email sign up ready
- [x] Create another chunk do the product

**To do this week**
- Finish one content piece (blog post)
- Share the page
- Outline and research second content piece
- Outline two other content pieces.
- Write a Lesson #1 email that delivers a quick win.

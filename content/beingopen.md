There's been a movement to build things out in the open. It's very refreshing to see this kind of transparency.

Some creators are using public to do list website like [Makerlog](https://getmakerlog.com/) or [WIP.chat](https://wip.co/)

Startups, websites, apps are also sharing the metrics, the process and the results. A few examples come to mind, [ConverKit](https://convertkit.baremetrics.com/, [Buffer](https://buffer.com/revenue), [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/company), [Baremetrics](https://demo.baremetrics.com/), [Ghost](https://ghost.org/about/) or [Nomad List](https://nomadlist.com/open).

Some lists with lots of companies:
- Open startups on [Baremetrics](https://baremetrics.com/open-startups)
- On [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/products?revenueVerification=stripe)

To support this movement some Saas projects are working on features to allow these metrics to be shared publicly. Most of them operate in the Issue tracking, Analytics, Revenue and Monitoring space. 

I'm also being open. You can find the analytics for this blog [here](https://app.splitbee.io/public/ameneres.com).

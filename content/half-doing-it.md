Shipping more or shipping better? They're both acceptable strategies with different trade-offs. Shipping more is a race to the bottom, it's not sustainable. Shipping better is a focus on differentiation.

For individual creators, doing more it's better than not doing at all but it's important to understand it's happening and why.

In my case, it's about consistency. I want to write daily until the end of the year. Some posts are good, some average and some bad. I could focus on increasing the value in each but that would make it difficult to publish daily. 

Practice is part of the craft. The craft requires different set skills. Daily practice contributes to that end.
 
After a while the focus should be on raising the value of the work. All the while enjoying the process of producing such work.

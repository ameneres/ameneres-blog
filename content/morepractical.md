I'm going to be more practical about the stack of the info product I'm launching. 

I was going to build the whole thing from scratch but it's too much work. Just grabbing an email form from an email marketing tool and customizing to fit the style is too much work. It's worth considering a different approach.

Here's what I need for the project:
1. Landing page
2. Collect emails
3. Send emails to subscribers
4. Create the ebook
5. Blog
6. Sell the ebook (and other resources)


For 1, 2 and 3 I'm going to use the same tool. I had chosen [Convertkit](https://convertkit.com/) but the free plan doesn't have the features I need. The first paid tier might be too steep for how small I think this porject will be. Need to compare it with a few options.

For 4, I'm going  to use [Canva](https://www.canva.com/.

For 5, still going to use  [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/). I can host it cheaply via static hosting. If a marketing tool offers this feature, I may consider it.

For  6, either Convertkit, [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) or [Podia](https://www.podia.com/).

The website won't change much once it's done. I'll be more practical.

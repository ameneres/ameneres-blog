Starting small. Putting most of my effort on Info products. 

I've been doing software sales for the 7 years. Going to use that experience to put my knowledge on paper and sell it. 

A lot of people start by doing just that. [Adam Wathan](https://adamwathan.me/courses/) with PHP, Javascript and Design courses. [Nathan Barry](https://nathanbarry.com/). And many others. Services like [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/) are experiencing sustained growth and allowing creators to sell easily online. A lot of those creators are selling info products.

Amy and Alex of [30x500](https://30x500.com/academy/) are big proponents of this strategy. They have a whole methodology to find your audience, understand their pain and how to reach them. I'm going to try out their [Year of Hustle](https://stackingthebricks.com/year-of-hustle/)

Let's start with that.

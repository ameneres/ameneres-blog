A big part of this blog is documenting my journey as a creator. I pre-launched on Monday my ebook [Research for sales](https://www.subscribepage.com/researchforsales)

Here's the list of activities required:
- Name for ebook
- Cover for ebook
- Landing page with subscription form
- Email automation with Thank you note for subscribers
- Linkedin post to tell the world

Ouch...I expected that list to be a lot longer. All this should have taken a day to do. It took me several weeks. Because I know how to build a website I was doing it myself. What I realise now is the time lost unconsciously on too many small decisions. 

The whole process still may take more than a day due to research and the learning curve. Research on which tools to use and how to use them. I'm using [Mailerlite](https://www.mailerlite.com/) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

This serves as a reminder to myself that I need to set [constraints](https://ameneres.com/post/settingconstrains) and that I can complicate things as much I want.

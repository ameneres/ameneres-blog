Too many distractions last week. Didn't achieve what I set out to do. Will need to make up for it this week. 

I'm trying to simplify the things I need to do. Used [Canva](https://www.canva.com) to create the cover for the ebook. For the landing page, I've decided to do it myself. It's a static page and I can host it on a platform like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Wanted to use the no-code tools but I don't think it's worth the cost at the moment. I do take pleasure in programming it and trying new tech. As long as I'm productive, this seems like a good way forward.

The goal for this monday post is to look back on the previous week and see if I made progress. For now, I'm going to post a list of to dos and see if it works.

**Done last week**
- [x] Content for description of the pain
- [x] Outline of the product
- [x] v0.1 of the landing page 
- [x] create cover for the ebook

**To do this week**
- Email sign up ready
- Create a chunk of the product
- Share the page
- Write a welcome email
- Create on content piece (blog post)

**What I'm reading?**

Every morning I sit in front on my laptop, open firefox and click on Tomato[^1]. This action starts a countdown of 25 minutes. It's a time management technique called [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

I've set myself this challenge of publishing a blog post every week day. Publishing every day it's not easy. I have three main challenges when creating these posts:
##### Idea
What I'm I going to write about?
This pushes for my creativity but it's tough to find a topic to write about.
		
##### Intent 
How's it for?
It can be for me and/or others. Most of the time it's for me. I'm putting down my thoughts as a way to a clear my thought process. 

(as an example, this post is more informative to others)

##### Depth 
How much do I want to share?
Depends on the topic and how I'm feeling. At the moment, it's short bites kind of content.


Since this is something I want to do daily I need to set [contraints](https://ameneres.com/post/settingconstrains). 

I'm putting constraints mainly on duration and editing. It can't take more than 1 or 2 "Tomatos". The posts are published very raw with minimal if any amounts of editing. There's no concern about word count but the content needs to relevant.
